			<h2>What is a domain?</h2>
			<p>To create a website you need two things: a domain; and web hosting. <small>Ok, if you want to be awkward 
			about it then you need a DNS, a nameserver etc, but that's usually included in the domain/hosting package.
			</small> When you search for a website, you usually type in its domain, such as "google.com" or 
			"sgscclub.org", and after going through a complex process which happens in a blink of an eye, the server 
			(in our case 000webhost's) sends your browser the files needed to view the web page.</p>
			<p>Domains are not free, thus 000webhost requires you to have your domain or use one of their subdomains. 
			Subdomains are free, so if you own "google.com" then you can have "play.google.com" for free, likewise if you 
			own "sgscclub.org" you can have "gaming.sgscclub.org". 000webhost utilises the domains that it owns, allowing 
			you to have your website on one of its subdomains.</p>
