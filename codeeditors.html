			<h2>Notepad++</h2>
			<p><i>Notepad++</i> is a Windows only code editor, which supports many different languages, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript and PHP.
            It is small, and takes up minimal space, while using minimal system resources.</p>
            <h2>Brackets</h2>
            <p>In my opinion, <i>Brackets</i> is <b>definately</b> the best Code Editor for any experienced developer, 
                although it may be confusing for begginers. It has many features, such as autocompletion and 
                suggests many parameters when typing tags. It supports Windows, Mac OS X and Debian, its 
                varients and its distributions. <small><i>Brackets</i> is open-source, and one should be able to
                compile it for any other Linux Distributions, although the binaries are only available for those 3 
                Operating Systems</small></p>
            <h2>Geany</h2>
            <p><i>Geany</i> is just like Notepad++, only that it also supports Mac OS X and Linux. I would recommend you to 
            use Geany if you don't have Windows and you like using Notepad++.</p>
            <h2>Neutron Drive</h2>
            <p>A cloud HTML editor which stores your files in Google Drive, gotta love that! One problem is that you can't view 
                HTML files "locally" when created, they need to be uploaded via FTP first.</p>
